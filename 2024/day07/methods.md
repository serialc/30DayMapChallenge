## QGIS

- Used QuickOSM to extract:
    - key: building
    - key: natural=water

- Created Trier inner-city (old city) bounds feature class
- Intersected bounds with downloaded OSM features bound by extent

Projection: ETRS89 / LCC Germany (N-E) (EPSG: 4839)

Did some simple faded outline symbology.

Printed to white paper.

## Inking and watercolours
I traced the outlines. I should have generalized the features and removed very small buildings in QGIS.

Added watercolours. Should have started with a light wash over large spaces and then done detail.
