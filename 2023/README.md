# 2023 Maps 

I am doing the #30DayMapChallenge with work colleagues. I will only be doing every third day.

## Day 1 - Points

- Gathered data with Jupyter notebook by scraping website data into CSV.
- In QGIS normalized data, used "Random Points in Polygons" tool to generate points.
- Stylized map in QGIS and exported as SVG.
- In InkScape I added text, did formatting/layout.
- Would have liked to take data into R and do a bit of statistical analysis to see which, if any of these rates of blank ballots are significant.

## Day 4 - A bad map

- Used the osmdata library to get the features for the area from OSM
- Map basic map in R. I should have gotten the symbology nicer there first...
- Used InkScape to clean up data, organize, and then style a bit. Would have liked to do more, but... time.
- The 'bad' aspect is that I seem to be promoting the 'bad' restaurants, or simply showing 'bad' restaurants.

## Day 7 - Navigation

- Used my GPS tracks from bus commute
- Imported into QGIS and converted to paths
- Set scale of the three maps in layout manager and exported
- Added text and tweaked layout in InkScape
